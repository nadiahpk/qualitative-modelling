# Method

1. ```macq1.py```: Defines the interaction network used, a Macquarie Island ecosystem
2. ```test_macq1.py```: Uses the the interaction network defined in ```macq1.py``` to do Monte Carlo simulations of species' response to rabbit control. It is currently set-up to run a quick test of the code. Results from running this on all of the tests have been collated together in ```collate_all.csv```
3. ```plot_test_macq1.py```: Creates results figures from ```collate_all.csv```


# Results

## Results of the tests

1. ```collate_all.csv```: A comma-separated file with the results used to generate the figures in the manuscript. Each row corresponds to a test in the manuscript (i.e. Raymond, Test 1, Test 2, etc.), with columns for the number of plausible community matrices found, the number of matrices that were rejected due to failing the plausibility criteria, and then subsequent columns are the number of positive and negative entries in the sensitivity matrix corresponding to species' responses to press perturbation of rabbits

## Figures for the manuscript

Results figures used in the manuscript.

1. ```rejections.pdf```: the average number of rejected draws per plausible community matrix found
2. ```response_[species name].pdf```: the proportion of positive responses to a successful rabbit control predicted in the ensemble of plausible community matrices
3. ```selected.pdf```: results selected for the body of the text
