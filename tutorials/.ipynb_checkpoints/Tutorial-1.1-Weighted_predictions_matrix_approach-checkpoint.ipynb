    "As explained in Dambacher et al. (2002), the elements in $W$, ranging between 0 and 1, indicate the determinacy of the response sign prediction obtained from $\\text{adj}(-^\\circ A)$. A value of 1 indicates that all of the feedbacks between a row and column species are of the same sign. This means that the species response to a press perturbation, regardless of the specific interaction-strength values, is guaranteed to match the sign in $\\text{adj}(-^\\circ A)$. Values less than one indicate indeterminacy: there is a combination of positive and negative feedback loops between the species in the system, and so the species response may be positive or negative, depending upon the specific interaction-strength values. A value of 0 indicates either that there are no feedbacks between the row and column species (see convention above), or that the number of positive and negative feedbacks are equal.\n",

    "$W_{ij} > 0.5$ corresponds to $>$ 75% of feedback loops having the same sign. Hosack et al. (2008) also used simulations, where interaction-strength values were sampled from various distributions, to obtain a relationship $W_{ij}$ and sign-determinacy.\n",

Given that $T_{ij} \\neq 0$ for the corresponding elements, this means that the response signs are maximally indeterminate: there are an equal number of positive and negative feedbacks between the perturbed species 3 and the other species."
